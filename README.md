Mozilla.com Selenium Tests
============================

This repository holds automated tests for [http://www.mozilla.org][MOZ]

[MOZ]: http://www.mozilla.org

Running Tests
-------------

### Python
Before you will be able to run these tests you will need to have Python 2.6 installed.

__note__

The instructions below will install the required Python libraries into your
global Python installation. If you work on multiple Python projects that might
end up needing different versions of the same libraries, you might want to
follow `sudo easy_install pip` with `sudo pip install virtualenv`, and then
create and activate a [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org) (e.g. `virtualenv
mcom-tests-env; source mcom-tests-env/bin/activate`) to create a clean
"virtual environment" for just this project. Then you can
`pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtual environment
without needing to use `sudo`.

If you don't mind installing globally, just run

    sudo easy_install pip

followed by

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

__note__

If you are running on Ubuntu/Debian you will need to first do

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

to install the required Python libraries.

### Running tests locally

To run tests locally, it's a simple case of calling the command below from this directory

    py.test --driver=firefox

For more command line options, see https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-mozwebqa

Pre-commit Hook
---------------

If you are on Linux or Mac OS, copy the file pre-commit to your git hooks folder

	cp pre-commit .git/hooks/

This  will add a pre-commit hook to run WebQA's flake8 configuration.
